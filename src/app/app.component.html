<!-- <app-header></app-header>  we will register it in the ts file of the component, in which html we are using this. in this case it is "app.component.ts" -->
<app-header />
<!-- <app-user></app-user> if the component tag doesn't have in between something, then we can simplify it. for example: <app-user/> -->
<main>
  <ul id="users">
    <li>
